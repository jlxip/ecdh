# Simple ECDH

Sometimes I want to communicate with others in a secure way over an insecure channel. PGP is absolutely great, but there are some scenarios in which I'd rather use something quick and dirty, so I wrote Simple ECDH for this.

I made this circa October 1st, 2020. This was originally at [https://jlxip.net/ecdh](https://jlxip.net/ecdh), which makes no sense since it works statically in the browser. Having it in GitHub:

- Makes it faster to load since GitHub Pages is way faster than my server
- Is way more trustworthy since there's no way I'm doing shenanigans
- Simplifies a tiny bit my server
- Might come in handy for someone who wants to have a look at the code

Since the amount of code here is laughable (~150 js lines), this is public domain.
