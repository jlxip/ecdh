        <h2 class="ml-3">Introduction</h2>
        <div class="m-3">
            <p class="text-justify">
                Congratulations, you have arrived at Simple ECDH.
                You're here because the person who sent you this link (let's call her Alice)
                wants to communicate securely with you (Bob).<br><br>

                Alice does not trust the channel you're currently chatting on.
                WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, Tinder, Instagram, Twitter: the companies that own
                these chats are able to, at any point, intercept the messages that are sent back
                and forth in the chat. This doesn't mean that they're doing it right now, but
                Alice feels like the subject she wants to talk to you is private enough so the
                information cannot be known by a third party.<br><br>

                With ECDH, you can start a secure communication in a non-secure channel.
                This applies to channels such as the listed above, where snooping is likely, but
                it is assumed that no tampering takes place.<br><br>

                To begin, a key exchange has to take place. Alice (the other party) generates a key,
                and Bob (you) does the same. Both share their keys on the channel and
                copy/paste them in the field below. Once that's done, Alice and Bob can derive
                a shared key with which they can encrypt and decrypt messages which can be safely
                sent throught the unsecure channel.<br><br>

                Please do keep in mind that this platform should not be used extensively for day
                to day communication, only during brief chat sessions; for instance, to figure out
                a more secure place to talk.
